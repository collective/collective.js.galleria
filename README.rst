Notes
=====

Galleria in its way to manage theme parse all link tags to find the css attached
to the theme. To make it work in production mode you must add themes javascript
and css called by the template. 
::

    // look for manually added CSS
    $('link').each(function( i, link ) {
        // Patch for Plone
        reg = new RegExp( theme.css.replace('\+\+resource\+\+','\\+\\+resource\\+\\+') );
        if ( reg.test( link.href ) ) {

            // we found the css
            css = true;

            // the themeload trigger
            _themeLoad( theme );

            return false;
        }
    });


As you can see the original code has been patched to support ++resource++ url.

Starting from version 1.6.1 this package is compatible only with Plone 5.2


Uglify Javascript
=================

To uglify Javascript, we can use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd src/collective/js/galleria/resources
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn uglifyjs

This will generate ``galleria.min.js`` uglify based on ``galleria.js``.
